All of the files that end in .scpt are Applescript documents.  If you have
trouble with these documents, you can copy and paste the .scpt.txt versions
into Script Editor and then compile and save them on your machine.


tcdf.scpt should be opened in Script Editor and saved as an Application
Use the export option under the file menu.
The resulting Application should be added to your Finder toolbar via dragging
it onto a toolbar that has "Customise Toolbar" active.


cdf_alias.sh and iterm_fns.sh should be sourced by your .bashrc or .bash_profile

fdc and posd should be put in your ~/bin dir, or /usr/local/bin (or somewhere in your path)
